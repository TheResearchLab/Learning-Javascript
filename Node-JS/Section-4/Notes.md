//=========== Debugging and Easier Development========//
- npm start to run code. Start is a special word. 
- Other commands can run code too but syntax to run will be different. npm run <property-name>
- npm repository is online
- if using code you can keep node_modules folder but if you don't need then you can delete until you do and just run 'npm install' do setup again
//=========== Error Handling ========//
- Syntax Error
- Runtime Errors (code that breaks when it runs)
- Logical Errors (No message just have to reverse engineer)
